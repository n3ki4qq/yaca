# Yet Another Chat Application
This application is being created for practice purposes only.

## About project

The main goal of this project is to create a cross-platform GUI chat application.
That is minimalistic, fast, and reliable. 

In other words, another Telegram clone

I will divide this project into stages, where I will list all the features that I want to develop per each stage.
Additionally, I will provide all the resources that I will use during the development of each stage, so you can follow along if you want.

## Stages
- Stage I (Console chat application) | DUE TO 09.09.2023
- Will be more soon :3

## Technologies
I plan to use C++ for my project, there is no crucial reason for this (or at least I didn't face it), it's just my personal preference.
For the GUI part, I'm currently choosing between Qt and GTK, because of their cross-platform features.

## Stage I

In the first stage, I'm going to implement a simple console chat application, just to get my hands dirty and learn more about sockets.

### What I need to implement
- [ ] Server
- [ ] Client
- [ ] OPTIONAL support for Windows sockets

### Resources
- [Unix Socket Tutorial (Beej guide)](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/pdf/bgnet_a4_c_1.pdf)
- [Windows Socket Tutorial (Johnie Rose)](https://johnnie.jerrata.com/winsocktutorial/)

Actually, I have a lot of interesting ideas for this project, so I will update this readme file frequently.
